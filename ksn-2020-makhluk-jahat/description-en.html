<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek is a skilled wizard. In the world where Pak Dengklek lives, there exist 
  $K$ different magic elements numbered from $1$ to $K$. In the beginning, Pak 
  Dengklek has mastered $4$ different magic elements, which are $S_1$, $S_2$, 
  $S_3$, and $S_4$.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek plans to attack a castle filled with evil spirits. Luckily, Pak 
  Dengklek has obtained information about the castle's architecture. The castle 
  consists of $N$ rooms numbered from $1$ to $N$. If Pak Dengklek is currently in 
  the $x$-th room, then Pak Dengklek can only visit the $(x+1)$-th room, but can not 
  go back to the $(x-1)$-th room.
</p><p>
  There exist $2$ types of room, fighting room and library. The $x$-th room has one 
  of the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>$1 \; A$: the $x$-th room is a fighting room. In this room, there exists an 
  evil spirit that Pak Dengklek can fight. This evil spirit masters the $A$-th magic element. 
  Pak Dengklek can also choose to not fight the evil spirit in this room, and 
  immediately move to the next room.</li>
  <li>$2$: the $x$-th room is a library. In this room, Pak Dengklek can learn to master one of 
  any new magic element, but he has to forget one magic element that he currently 
  masters. Pak Dengklek can also choose to not master a new magic element if he does not 
  want to forget magic elements that he currently masters, and immediately move to 
  the next room.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek's ability to defeat evil spirits is represented 
  by the matrix $M$. Matrix $M$ has the size of $K \times K$, where each of its elements can be 
  either $0$ or $1$. The rows and columns of $M$ are numbered from $1$ to $K$.
  If Pak Dengklek masters magic element $i$, Pak Dengklek can defeat 
  evil spirits that master magic element $j$ if and only if the $i$-th row and $j$-th column 
  of matrix $M$ is $1$.
</p>
<p>
  Before attacking the castle, Pak Dengklek asks for your advice so that he can 
  defeat as many evil spirits as possible. Help Pak Dengklek count the maximum 
  number of evil spirits that he can defeat!
