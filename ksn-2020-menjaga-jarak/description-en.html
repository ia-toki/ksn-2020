<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek has a shop. One day, there are $N$ customers queueing in front of his shop. 
  Those customers are numbered from $1$ to $N$, from the customer in front of the queue to the 
  back of the queue, respectively. The $i$-th customer has health level $H_i$.
</p><p>
  During this pandemic, his shop follows the health protocol to keep the distance. Therefore, Pak Dengklek 
  wants to split these $N$ customers into several groups:
</p><p>
  Several customers in the front of the queue are in the first group and welcomed to enter the shop. 
  Then, after the first group is finished, the next several customers in front of the queue 
  are in the second group and welcomed to enter the shop. This process will go on 
  until the last few customers are in the last group and welcomed to enter the shop.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek decided that in a group, there should be no more than $M$ customers which have 
  the same health level. Pak Dengklek also want the number of groups created is as few as possible.
  To achieve that, Pak Dengklek can choose up to $K$ customers to leave the queue. 
  These customers will not be in any group and are not welcomed to enter the shop. It is possible for  
  Pak Dengklek to ask everyone to leave the queue so that he does not need to create any groups.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek asked you to manage how to split the customers into several groups such that the 
  number of groups is minimized. Help Pak Dengklek to count the minimum number of groups needed!

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek can ask the $6$-th customer to leave. The first group consists of the $1$-st,
